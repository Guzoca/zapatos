For the Social media Authentication I used Facebook.

For this i used PHP login with Facebook:
 -I create an account in Facebook
 -in  developers i create a Facebook app
 -I used the existent data base to to connect.
 -I modified the code and include the following

Name: AppStore
Facebook Authentication
App Id
1145185915554654
App secret
dae245a51f6bd921d489b2904ba8aa2a

for the authentication i got and error because i havenâ€™t buy a domain to upload it, but is working perfect.

The UML Diagram is the document UML-MODEL.pdf

The final data base sql document is DATABASE.sql I create a copie for easy access,
the file name DatabaseFNLcopy.
